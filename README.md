#Cape Town Hometown Homepage

Welcome to my personal homepage about my hometown, Cape Town, a beautiful city located at the southern tip of Africa. This website was developed as part of my coursework with Code Your Future, an organization that supports individuals who are interested in coding, web development, and pursuing careers in digital technology.
The website provides an introduction to Cape Town's travel destinations, culture, and history. The project is designed using HTML and CSS, aiming to showcase the city's unique beauty as a rainbow city having diffrent races and cultures

In the future, I plan to:
Add interactivity with JavaScript (e.g., a map or interactive galleries).
Include more detailed information about each of Cape Town's major landmarks.
Enhance the website's design with animations or transitions.
