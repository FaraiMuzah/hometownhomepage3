    <h2>About Cape Town</h2>
    <p>Cape Town, a stunning coastal city nestled at the foot of Table Mountain, is a vibrant reflection of South Africa’s diversity and its spirit as the "Rainbow Nation." This nickname, coined by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, symbolizes the country’s transformation from the painful divisions of apartheid to a unified, multicultural society. In Cape Town, this diversity is evident in its rich mix of cultures, languages, and traditions, which are woven together into the city’s fabric. From the historical significance of the District Six museum to the colorful houses of Bo-Kaap, Cape Town celebrates both its complex past and its hopeful future. As a melting pot of South Africa’s people, Cape Town stands as a living testament to the resilience, harmony, and inclusivity that define the Rainbow Nation.</p>
